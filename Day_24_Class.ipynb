    "# Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "# It is a fundamental concept in OOPs that allow a class (child class) to inherit attribute and methods from another class (Parent class) \n",
    "# this promotes code reusability and modularity\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key Benifits of Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.) Code Reusability - The child class can reuse the code in the parent class\n",
    "# 2.) Extensibility - The child class can add or modify the functionalitites of the parent class\n",
    "# 3.) Heirarichal Structure - Relationship between classes are more organized\n",
    "\n",
    "# Types of Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.) Single Inheritance - A child class inherits from one parent class\n",
    "# 2.) Multiple Inheritance - A child class inherits from two or more parent classes\n",
    "# 3.) Multilevel Inheritance - A child class inherits from a parent class and that parent class inherits from another parent classes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Class Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "# It is a method that operates on the class itself rather than or instance of the class, it is defined using the @ class method decorator\n",
    "# and takes \"CLS\"(same as self) class reference as its first parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "# Features of class parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.) It operates on the class rather then instance specific data\n",
    "# 2.) We can modify tthe class state using CLS\n",
    "# 3.) It can be called on both class and its objects\n"
